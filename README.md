# Natural-List-Build-for-Testing-and-Verification-Task


Natural List Build Task for Testing and Verification 

This project focuses on implementing and verifying contracts in Java for two classes: Natural and NaturalList. The Natural class represents a non-negative integer, while NaturalList manages a collection of these natural numbers. The goal is to ensure that all operations on these classes adhere to strict preconditions, postconditions, and invariants, preventing invalid states such as overflow or null references.

Key Tasks:
Invariants: Define the strongest possible invariants for both Natural and NaturalList.

Contracts: Write the weakest preconditions and strongest postconditions for all specified methods.

Testing: Develop comprehensive test cases, including scenarios that violate preconditions and those that satisfy postconditions.

Tools & Environment:
Eclipse IDE: All development and testing must be done in Eclipse.

Cofoja: Used for contract enforcement via annotations.

JUnit: For writing and running tests.

Why This Project?
This project is a deep dive into design by contract, a powerful paradigm for ensuring software reliability. By mastering contracts, you'll learn how to write robust, error-resistant code that behaves predictably under all conditions.
